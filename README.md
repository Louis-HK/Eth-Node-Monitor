# Eth-Node-Monitor
Lightweight Web-Based Ethereum Node Monitor  A simple and responsive web application built with Flask to monitor the synchronization status of both the Execution Layer (Geth) and the Consensus Layer (Beacon Node) of an Ethereum node. 

Ethereum Node Monitor – Lightweight Web Dashboard for Geth & Beacon**
A minimal yet powerful web-based monitoring tool for Ethereum node operators.
Built with Python Flask, it provides real-time synchronization status for both:

Execution Layer (Geth) – via JSON-RPC (eth_syncing)
Consensus Layer (Beacon Node) – via REST API (/eth/v1/node/syncing)
Key Features

✅ Real-time sync status updates

🌐 Remote web access (if port is open)

📦 Lightweight & easy to deploy

💻 No command-line interaction needed

📱 Responsive design (desktop & mobile)
